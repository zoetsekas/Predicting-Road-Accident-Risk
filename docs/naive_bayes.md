# Naive Bayes for Road Accident Risk Prediction

Naive Bayes is a simple and fast classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem with a "naive" assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features.

## Advantages

- **Fast and Efficient**: Naive Bayes is computationally inexpensive and can be trained quickly, even on large datasets.

- **Simple to Implement**: The algorithm is easy to understand and implement from scratch.

- **Performs Well on Small Datasets**: It can often perform surprisingly well, even with a small amount of training data.

- **Good Baseline Model**: Due to its simplicity and speed, Naive Bayes is an excellent choice for a baseline model to compare against more complex algorithms.

## Disadvantages

- **Naive Independence Assumption**: The core assumption of feature independence is often violated in real-world scenarios, which can lead to suboptimal performance.

- **Sensitivity to Feature Distribution**: Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes that continuous features follow a Gaussian distribution. If this is not the case, the model's performance can be affected.

- **Zero-Frequency Problem**: If a categorical variable has a category in the test data set that was not observed in the training data set, the model will assign a zero probability and will be unable to make a prediction.
