# Neural Network for Road Accident Risk Prediction

A feedforward neural network, built with PyTorch, was also used to model the relationship between the input features and accident risk. While tree-based models are often preferred for tabular data, neural networks can sometimes capture complex non-linear patterns that other models might miss.

## Advantages

- **Can Capture Complex Relationships**: Neural networks are universal function approximators, meaning they can learn highly complex, non-linear relationships between features.

- **Flexible Architecture**: The architecture of a neural network (e.g., number of layers, neurons, activation functions) can be customized to fit the specific problem, allowing for a high degree of flexibility.

- **Good for Large Datasets**: Neural networks can continue to improve in performance as the size of the dataset grows, whereas tree-based models may plateau.

## Disadvantages

- **Less Interpretable**: Neural networks are often considered "black boxes" because it is difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions. This can be a drawback in applications where interpretability is important.

- **Requires More Data**: They typically require a larger amount of data to train effectively compared to tree-based models. With smaller datasets, they are more prone to overfitting.

- **Computationally Expensive**: Training neural networks can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, often requiring specialized hardware like GPUs to be efficient.

- **Sensitive to Feature Scaling**: Neural networks are sensitive to the scale of the input features, so proper normalization or standardization is a critical preprocessing step.

## Monitoring and Debugging with TensorBoard

To provide a "glass-box" view into the training process, the pipeline is configured to log detailed, model-specific information to TensorBoard. For the neural network, this includes the distribution of **weights** and **gradients** for each layer at each training step.

### Why is this useful?

-   **Vanishing Gradients**: If the gradient distributions are all clustered around zero, it indicates that the network is not learning effectively. This can be a sign that the learning rate is too low or that the network is too deep.

-   **Exploding Gradients**: If the gradients have extremely large values, it can cause the training to become unstable. This might suggest that the learning rate is too high or that gradient clipping is needed.

-   **Dead Neurons**: If the weights of a layer stop changing over time, it can indicate that the neurons in that layer have become inactive (e.g., due to the ReLU activation function). This can be a sign that the learning rate is too low or that the network is not well-initialized.

By visualizing these distributions in TensorBoard, you can gain valuable insights into the health of your neural network and diagnose potential problems early in the training process.
